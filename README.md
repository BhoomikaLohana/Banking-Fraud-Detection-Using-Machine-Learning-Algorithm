# Banking-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
## Objective of the project

The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions in banking systems using Machine Learning techniques and advanced statistical methods. We aim to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent with high accuracy by applying a series of techniques.

We start by using K-Means Clustering to identify irregularities by analyzing distances from cluster centroids. Then, DBSCAN is applied to flag suspicious transactions based on density. Next, Z-Score Analysis helps detect extreme statistical outliers, followed by Isolation Forest to pinpoint transactions that deviate significantly from normal patterns. Finally, Logistic Regression is used as a supervised learning model to classify transactions based on historical data.

By combining these methods, we aim to develop a robust and effective fraud detection solution. The results from all models will be integrated to create a clear and accurate list of fraudulent transactions, ensuring that no suspicious activity is overlooked and providing a reliable solution.

## Conclusion

In this project, I explored the application of machine learning in detecting fraudulent transactions within banking systems. Through a series of supervised and unsupervised techniques, including Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, Z-Score Analysis, and Isolation Forest, I was able to identify fraudulent activities with notable accuracy.

By combining multiple approaches, I was able to uncover valuable insights into transactional patterns, flag suspicious transactions, and pinpoint accounts with frequent fraudulent activities. The threat level system, based on Boolean values of suspicious behaviors, helped prioritize the most concerning transactions for further investigation, enabling faster and more accurate fraud detection.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how machine learning and advanced statistical techniques can significantly enhance the security and efficiency of banking systems. The ability to detect fraud in real time, identify anomalies, and prioritize high-risk transactions has the potential to reduce financial losses, improve customer trust, and strengthen overall banking operations.
